Objective: The objective of this assignment is to implement the RNA secondary structure prediction
algorithm described in the class.

Input: RNA sequence
Output: Optimial pairing of the bases for largest RNA secondary structure folding


Rules:

Given a string over {A, T, C, G}, find the optimal set of base pairs i, j such that

- (No sharp turns) The ends of each pair are separated by at least 4 intervening bases i.e. if (i , j) Îµ S, then i < j - 4
- The elements in each pair in S consist of either {A,U} or {C,G} (in either order).
- S is a matching: no base appears in more than one pair.
- (No knots) If (i,j) and (k,l) are two pairs in S, then we cannot have i < k < j < l.

Recurrence :  OPT(i,j) = max(OPT(i,j-1), max(1 + OPT(i,t-1) + OPT(t+1, j-1) where i< t< j and valid pairing))

Complexity:

 - Recursion in caluculing 2D memo table: O(n^3)
 - Traceback: O(n^3)

 Overall Time Complexity: O(n^3)

Space:

 - O(n) to store RNA sequence 
 - O(n^2) for memoization table
 - O(n) to store output string

Overall Space Complexity: O(n^2)

Assignment was fun overall and easier than Assignment 1
